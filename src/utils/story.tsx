    `Your source is probably right. If you want to follow through with this investigation, you need funds. Your account being frozen for "suspicious activity" is likely an attempt to intimidate you.`,

    "And most importantly, no one can ever stop you from accessing it. Never.",
    "Real money, you mean the one in your bank account that you can no longer use since they froze it?",

    "About 30 million of people use it, plus it's just a browser extension.",
    "I'll guide you, we'll do it together.",
    "So when Metamask will be added to your browser a new tab will open and ask you to create a new wallet ",
    "First you will have to set up a password to access the extension on your device.",
    "Then, comes the most important step. Metamask will generate randomly 12 words. This is what we call the master key.",
    "This is the only key to open your mailbox if we come back to the previous metaphor.",
    "If you lose it, your wallet will be locked forever.",
    "And if someone can access these words, he will have access to everything that is stored inside.",
    "That's why keeping those 12 words in a safe place is essential.",
    "Come back to me once you have completed all the steps I just described to you."
