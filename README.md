# Revolte
Create an amazing Web3 experience

Revolte is an adventure game to onboard Web2 users into Web3.
We want to provide a complete journey with a real immersive story to attract people and encourage them to achieve small steps to follow up the narrative. These steps (like installing a wallet) are mandatory to get access to the next part of the story.

This playful fiction explains and illustrates each concept and tool in a non boring/forbidding way, with a relation with story events. The level of knowledge is increasing slowly to keep everyone in the adventure. It is inspired from https://cryptozombies.io/ but instead of learning Solidity the goal of the project is to learn basic tasks:
- Install and use a wallet
- Execute transactions
- Swap tokens,
- Use decentralized applications
- Discover Layer 2 like Optimism 

Another good example about what we want to build is https://ethereumhacker.com/ but for learning basics about blockchain instead of vulnerabilities in smart contracts 

## Genesis

During 2021-22 we developed a project for French Government and European Union about decentralized identity. We did a lot of user testings. 99% of our users had no knowledge about Web3, decentralization and wallet. They were immediately afraid by the idea of installing an extension and keeping safe the seed phrase. They was not understanding why our portal was not using login/password like other websites.
It was obvious that there was an important step change for onboarding new people in Web3. Manuals, guides, tutorials, videos are useful but only for people with an interest for this ecosystem. A lot of people don't have time or motivation to discover a new user experience.

In September 2022 we decided to create a dapp for everyone from FIFA World Cup. It was a prediction game with no loser. There were 5.4 billions of viewers for the World Cup, it was a perfect purpose for onboarding people. We added a feature to use the application : connect with your email address.
Despite this, the onboarding was really difficult for new comers : You need to buy token for making transactions, you have to swap or buy stablecoins for using dapp, you have to approve spending (without understanding what you are approving). Even the connection with email was unsatisfactory (you are not owner of your keys).

Something is missing ! Without easy/fun Web3 on-ramp, a mass adoption is utopian.
Revolte is using game approach and is an interactive story which capture the attention to hold users spelbound.

## Overview

Revolte is based on a dystopian universe, similar to an interactive comic. The adventure is split in 3 chapters :
 1. No relation with Web3. The aim is to introduce the story/universe and to grab audience's attention. At the end of the chapter we explain what is a wallet and how to install it.
 2. Wallet is mandatory for chapter 2. The narration of the story details how works a wallet and what are its benefits. This chapter introduces basic concepts and uses of a wallet: public/private key, gas, token, block explorer, NFTs, ... At the end of chapter 2 a deposit we explain how to do a deposit on Aave
 3. A deposit is required to start chapter 3. This section goes deeper in Web3 use : swap, deposit/borrow, bridge, layer 2, ...
